SaberWars
===

SaberWars is the result of my Final Project for a Visual Basic class in college.
The assignment was to take a classic video game idea and put our own spin on it.

Code

There are two main files which contain the code that I wrote for this game.

You can view the introduction and character selection code
[here](https://github.com/wickhama09/SaberWars/blob/master/Final_Anthony_Wickham/FrmGame.vb),  
and the game execution code

Thoughts

This was probably the most "fun" project that I created in college, and was my one of my first experiences with Visual Studio. It taught me a lot
about event-driven programming using Windows Form objects and the many ways you can manipulate them. I have often thought of redoing this program
in a more efficient language now that I am significantly more experienced with programming.
