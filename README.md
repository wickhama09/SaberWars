SaberWars
===

SaberWars is a Windows application that I drafted and developed. Designed for 2-Players, this game is a spin-off of the classic video game "Pong".

Thoughts

This was probably the most "fun" project that I created in college, and was a final project for a Visual Basic class. While working on this project, I got familiar with animation, windows form objects, and the many ways you can manipulate them. I have often thought of redoing this program for a mobile device now that I have significantly more experience with programming.
